    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unmanaged home charging of electric vehicles typically follows a **plug-and-charge** pattern: drivers connect the vehicle upon arrival, and charging starts immediately until the battery is full.  \n",
    "While convenient, this approach ignores substantial intra-day variation in electricity prices. Aligning charging decisions with hourly price signals can reduce household expenditures without compromising vehicle availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main research question**\n",
    "\n",
    "> How much money can an individual EV owner save yearly by optimizing their charging schedule based on the hourly price of electricity?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we:\n",
    "1. Explore how electricity prices fluctuate within a day and across the seasons throughout 2024.  \n",
    "2. Compare yearly charging costs for different energy contract types — both fixed and dynamic.  \n",
    "3. Develop an optimization approach that determines the most cost-efficient charging schedule under realistic daily constraints such as arrival and departure time, battery state, and charging power.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture a range of real-world usage patterns, we model four representative EV user types:  \n",
    "**the Distant Commuter, the City Hopper, the Road Tripper, and the Grocery Grabber.**  \n",
    "These profiles differ in driving frequency and daily distance, which directly affect charging needs and potential cost savings.\n",

    "### General Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- All users charge at home using a **7.4 kW single-phase wallbox**.  \n",
    "- Vehicle efficiency: **0.17 kWh per km**.  \n",
    "- Charging window: **18:00 – 07:00** (arrival to departure).  \n",
    "- The vehicle must reach the **target state of charge by 07:00** each driving day.  \n",
    "- Electricity price data: **hourly prices for 2024 from [jeroen.nl](https://www.jeroen.nl/)** (dynamic prices in the Netherlands).  \n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Hourly electricity prices from the 2024 dataset were **grouped by hour of the day** (0–23) and analyzed to determine the **average daily distribution**.  \n",
    "A **box-and-whisker plot** was used to visualize price variability and highlight recurring hourly trends.  \n",

    "<p align=\"center\"><b>Figure 2.</b> Hourly distribution of electricity prices in 2024 (including taxes).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 reveals a clear and predictable daily pattern.  \n",
    "Electricity prices tend to be **lowest during the night and early morning hours** (00:00–06:00), when overall demand is minimal.  \n",
    "Prices rise sharply in the morning as residential and industrial activities begin, reaching a **first peak between 08:00 and 10:00**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During midday, prices often **decrease again** due to increased solar-energy generation, which temporarily boosts supply and lowers wholesale prices.  \n",
    "A **second, more pronounced peak** appears between 18:00 and 20:00, corresponding to evening household demand from cooking, heating, and appliance use, combined with the simultaneous decline in solar output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "These daily price fluctuations are primarily driven by the **balance between electricity demand and renewable-energy supply**, especially solar power.  \n",
    "The market responds dynamically to these factors, producing a consistent **double-peak pattern** throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an EV-charging perspective, this pattern suggests that **charging during nighttime or early-morning hours** is significantly more cost-efficient than charging during daytime or evening peaks.  \n",
    "Aligning charging sessions with low-price periods can therefore lead to **substantial annual savings** in electricity costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight forms the foundation for the following analyses, which examine **seasonal price variation** and quantify the **yearly savings potential** for EV owners who optimize their charging schedules.\n"
