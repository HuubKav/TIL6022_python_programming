    "Small logistics firms increasingly consider electrifying their vehicles, but volatile hourly electricity prices make charging costs uncertain, and upfront EV investments are hard to justify without clear savings. This report focuses on when to charge, not just how much, by optimizing depot charging against dynamic prices, ensuring vehicles leave with the required State of Charge. As an optional extension, we assess whether adding rooftop solar meaningfully lowers grid purchases and shortens payback. The outcome is a practical, data-driven guideline for small companies to cut operating costs and make informed steps toward cleaner transport.\n",
